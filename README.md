# database_sandbox
Resources for working with databases and SQL

Files for each database are saved in a separate folder

Folders contain files for:
- creating the database tables
- populating the tables with data
- query challenge questions (file names end with: `query_challenges`)
- solutions to the query challenge questions (file names end with: `query_solns`)

## Usage

- Fork this repo!
- Try the query challenge questions before looking at the solutions
- Here are instructions for connecting to a sample MySQL database through the UVA SDS compute resource CEDS
- If you don't have access to CEDS, you can send a request to your Program Director
